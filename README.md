# TailAdmin Laravel Starter Kit

This starter kit is based on [TailAdmin Laravel - Free Laravel Dashboard](https://github.com/TailAdmin/tailadmin-laravel).

We decided to merge our [LaravelDaily/starter-kit](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/starter-kit) with TailAdmin components.

As a result, you get full **simple** Laravel Auth (*login, register, forget password, profile*), styled as TailAdmin.

The main point is no React/Vue/Livewire required. Only Blade and Tailwind.

Also, you're getting an example table/form with two-level menu on the sidebar to manage Users.

## How to use

To use this kit, you can install it using:

```
laravel new --using=laraveldaily/tailadmin-starter-kit
```

From there, you can modify the kit to your needs and add more pages.

For more components, TailAdmin theme also has a [Pro version](https://checkout.tailadmin.com/buy/ed68b4bb-f0c6-4d20-a241-d3a5a81b0f25?aff=EEK4LN) (*affiliate link to support my work*) with 500+ components and dashboard variants.
